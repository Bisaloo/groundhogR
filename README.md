CRAN contains the officially released versions. 

On github, here, you will find development versions which may change and could even introduce backwards incompatibilities (from one *un*released version to another). 
Typos and silly bugs are likely in this development version. Unless you are attempting to contribute to groundhog actively, you should stick to the CRAN version.
