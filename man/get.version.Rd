\usage{
get.version(
  pkg,
  date,
  current.deps = .pkgenv$current.deps,
  patch = c("current", "max")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{character string with name of target package to install,
need not be in quotes.}

\item{date}{character string, or date value, with the date which determines the
version of the package, and all dependencies, to be installed. It's in yyyy-mm-dd format.}

\item{current.deps}{character vector with dependencies that, if needed, will be
installed with the newest version between the requested date the release of the
version of R being used, instead of necessarily with the version implied by the
date. Default includes series of C++ related packages which tend to be incompatible
across R versions (to see the set of packages run 'groundhog:::default.current.deps()')}

\item{patch}{Either \code{"current"} for the exact current version of the \code{pkg}
at the specified date, or \code{"max"} for the version with the same major and
minor but maximal patch version numbers.}
}
