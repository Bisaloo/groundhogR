\item{pkg}{character string dependencies which}

\item{date}{date (yyyy-mm--dd) for version that determines version of package to be loaded}

\item{ignore.deps}{optional character vector containing dependencies which
may mismatch those implied by the entered date and be tolerated. This will
prevent the installation to stop and request restarting the R session for
specified dependencies.}

\item{force.source}{Logical (defaults to \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE},` will skip CRAN
and MRAN attempts, download tar.gz, and install from it.}

\item{force.install}{Logical (defaults to \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, even if
package is found for this R-build, it will reinstall it.}
}
