    #                             TESTING GROUNDHOG 
#
#This script enables testing {groundhog} under various scenarios
#
#Because groundhog installs packages, and because the goal is 0 dependencies for groundhog
#these tests are not implemented using {testthat} nor are they run automatically
#This script is meant merely for sharing how groundhog is tested by the maintainer of the package
#i.e., for transparency of quality control. It is also useful for people who want to contribute to
#the package
